## Description


This Git repo contains the files for our student project in "Programmation Web". With our very first website, which is obviously inspired by Twitter, we try to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript while also getting familiar with Git and GitHub.


## Problems

### With Github

Currently, two contributors were not able to successfully initalise git at home or at university, so we could not use Github the way we wanted to. That means the contributions graphics deviate from the actual work done by each person. 

### With Jade and Node.js

We struggle to understand and/or work with Jade and node.js, as it is too advanced, especially for those of us who are just getting into basic HTML and CSS and who had not expected this to be part of our syllabus. After all, this course did not require any previous knowledge in Web Programming.  
Still, we tried our best, hence our :  

## Solutions 

We had started off with a Simple_HTML_Website to test how to work with Bootstrap and to have a basic setup of our webpage. Obviously, without a server-side language such as PHP, the website was is static. Simple JavaScript is not suited to save new users and tweets.  
  
Node.js is obivously more helpful in that department, but as the Power Point that was shown to us stated: is it not for beginners. Sadly, we are, so we particularly struggled with this part.
